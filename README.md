# UserManager API

UserManager is a versatile REST API tailored for managing person-related data. It empowers you with the fundamental Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on a "person" resource, enabling seamless interaction with person data. This API shines with its ability to dynamically handle parameters, making tasks like adding or retrieving a person by name a breeze.

## Features
- **Create**: Effortlessly add new person records to the database.
- **Read**: Retrieve individual person details or obtain a comprehensive list of all persons.
- **Update**: Modify existing person records with ease.
- **Delete**: Effortlessly remove person records when they are no longer needed.
